creating a program capable of executing the first 100 steps of a modified cellular life simulator.  This simulator will receive the path to the input file as an argument containing the starting cellular matrix.  The program must then simulate the next 100 time-steps based on the algorithm discussed in the attached document.  The simulation is guided by a handful of simplistic rules that will result in a seemingly complex simulation of cellular organisms.
