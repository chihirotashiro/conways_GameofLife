# conways_GameofLife
Creating a program capable of executing the first 100 steps of a modified cellular life simulator.  This simulator will receive the path to the input file as an argument containing the starting cellular matrix.  The program must then simulate the next 100 time-steps based on the algorithm discussed in the attached document.  The simulation is guided by a handful of simplistic rules that will result in a seemingly complex simulation of cellular organisms. Your solution must also make use of the multiprocessing module and spawn a total number of processes
equivalent to the number specified by the user in the -p option. Keep in mind that your program running normally would be considered running serially, in other words on a single thread/process. Failure to make use of proper multiprocessing using the multiprocessing module in Python will result in your solution being treated as entirely incorrect.
